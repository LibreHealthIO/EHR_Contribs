Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG): Deep Sternal Wound Infection Rate
National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care\\nNOTE: This is an INVERSE measure. A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control.

Did patient, within 30 days postoperative, develop deep sternal wound infection involving muscle, bone, and/or mediastinum require operative intervention?
Patient must have ALL of the following conditions: 1.) wound opened with excision of tissue (incision and drainage) or re-exploration of mediastinum, 2.) positive culture unless patient is on antibiotics at time of culture or no culture obtained, and 3.) treatment with antibiotics beyond perioperative prophylaxis.

Development of deep sternal wound infection/mediastinitis.
(G8571) (Performance Met, INVERSE MEASURE)
G8571

No deep sternal wound infection/mediastinitis.

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG): Stroke
National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care\\nNOTE: This is an INVERSE measure. A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control.

Stroke following isolated CABG surgery.
(G8573) (Performance Met, INVERSE MEASURE)

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG): Postoperative Renal Failure
National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care\\nNOTE: This is an INVERSE measure. A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control.

Did patient undergoing isolated CABG surgery develop postoperative renal failure or require dialysis?
Definition of renal failure/dialysis requirement - patient had acute renal failure or worsening renal function resulting in one of the following: 1) increase of serum creatinine to = 4.0 mg/dL or 3x most recent preoperative creatinine level (acute rise must be at least 0.5 mg/dL), or 2) a new requirement for dialysis postoperatively.

Developed postoperative renal failure or required dialysis.
(G8575) (Performance Met, INVERSE MEASURE)

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG): Surgical Re-Exploration
National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care\\nNOTE: This is an INVERSE measure. A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control. 

Did patient require a return to the operating room during the current hospitalization for mediastinal bleeding with or without tamponade, graft occlusion, valve dysfunction, or other cardiac reason?
.

Re-exploration required due to mediastinal bleeding.
(G8577) (Performance Met, INVERSE MEASURE)
