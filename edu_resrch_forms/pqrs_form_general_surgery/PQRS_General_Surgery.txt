Anastomotic Leak Intervention
National Quality Strategy Domain: Patient Safety\\nNOTE: A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control. The “Performance Not Met” numerator option for this measure is the representation of the better clinical quality or control. Reporting that numerator option will produce a performance rate that trends closer to 0%, as quality increases. For inverse measures a rate of 100% means all of the denominator eligible patients did not receive the appropriate care or were not in proper control, and therefore an inverse measure at 100% does not qualify for reporting purposes, however any reporting rate less than 100% does qualify.

Did patient require an anastomotic leak intervention following gastric bypass or colectomy surgery?
Patients aged 18 years and older.

Intervention for presence of leak of endoluminal contents through an anastomosis required.
(G9306) (Performance Met, INVERSE MEASURE)
G9306

Unplanned Reoperation within the 30 Day Postoperative Period
National Quality Strategy Domain: Patient Safety\\nNOTE: A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control. The “Performance Not Met” numerator option for this measure is the representation of the better clinical quality or control. Reporting that numerator option will produce a performance rate that trends closer to 0%, as quality increases. For inverse measures a rate of 100% means all of the denominator eligible patients did not receive the appropriate care or were not in proper control, and therefore an inverse measure at 100% does not qualify for reporting purposes, however any reporting rate less than 100% does qualify.

Unplanned Hospital Readmission within 30 Days of Principal Procedure
National Quality Strategy Domain: Effective Clinical Care\\nNOTE: A lower calculated performance rate for this measure indicates better clinical care or control. The “Performance Not Met” numerator option for this measure is the representation of the better clinical quality or control. Reporting that numerator option will produce a performance rate that trends closer to 0%, as quality increases. For inverse measures a rate of 100% means all of the denominator eligible patients did not receive the appropriate care or were not in proper control, and therefore an inverse measure at 100% does not qualify for reporting purposes, however any reporting rate less than 100% does qualify.

Did patient have an unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of the principal procedure?
